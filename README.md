# Scalpel
Object-Oriented Rendering Library providing a lightweight simple layer for some opengl calls.

Most of the code comes from a project I'm working on labeled '2fc0f18.' I moved the code and relicenced it as MIT open source, so that others can benefit from it and I can use this in various other projects.
